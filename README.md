## 🔧 Maintenance & Self-Healing
If the application encounters database ID mismatches (common in certain legacy MySQL environments), the built-in `DatabaseInitializer` and `StringLongConverter` will automatically sanitize and repair the schema on the fly. 

> **Tip**: If you receive a `403 Forbidden` after a long session, simply re-run the **Login** request to refresh your JWT token.
